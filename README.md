# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Things to note

- The label fonts are not correct, they should not be in italics, but customising react-native-paper is a bit challenging and takes a bit more time. I have left it as is for now,
- Given how not standard the styling is (i.e everything needing to be customised or designed from scratch), it take significantly more time to implement the design,
- I noticed some pattern between the different screens, the ScreenWrapper component could handle the common styling and functionalities to reduce code duplication, refactor/maintanance overhead and improve readability,
- The procduct images would ideally come from an API and not stored in code,
